What are Custom Exceptions in python? What do we need Custom Exceptions ? Explain in with an example\n","\n","=>Custom exceptions are user-defined exceptions in Python. They allow you to define specific types of exceptions for your application, so you can handle errors and exceptions in a more organized and meaningful way.\n","\n","For example, consider a scenario where you are writing a library that performs some mathematical calculations. In this library, you may encounter several different types of errors, such as invalid input, overflow, and divide-by-zero errors. You could handle these errors by raising built-in exceptions, such as ValueError or ZeroDivisionError, but it may not provide enough context or information about the error that has occurred.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"PRiVlrz-bgRj"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":31,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-qN9FbwfbbI_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687629389806,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4087,"user":{"displayName":"Kalpesh Patil","userId":"17000745813800247736"}},"outputId":"86a12808-37ca-4389-ac4f-4f9c2fc771e9"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["enter your balance 120\n"]}],"source":["balance= int(input(\"enter your balance \"))"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class validbalance(Exception):\n","\n","  def __init__(self,mag):\n","    self.mag= mag\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NBUWP-k3brca","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687629389808,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":27,"user":{"displayName":"Kalpesh Patil","userId":"17000745813800247736"}}},"execution_count":32,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def validatbalance(balance):\n","  if balance < 0:\n","    raise validbalance(\"balance is nagetive\")\n","  elif balance >= 10000:\n","    raise validbalance(\"enter balance is very high \")\n","  else:\n","    print(\"enter balance is valied\")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tpokZyc8eXqs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687629389810,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":26,"user":{"displayName":"Kalpesh Patil","userId":"17000745813800247736"}}},"execution_count":33,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["try :\n","  balance= int(input(\"enter your balance \"))\n","  validatbalance(balance)\n","except validbalance as e :\n","  print(e)\n","\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"rRVD142effSi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687629394184,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4388,"user":{"displayName":"Kalpesh Patil","userId":"17000745813800247736"}},"outputId":"ee594a70-735e-4008-fd27-f80eae3840dd"},"execution_count":34,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["enter your balance 11000\n","enter balance is very high \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"qXkYDHgsf_b5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687629394185,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Kalpesh Patil","userId":"17000745813800247736"}}},"execution_count":34,"outputs":[]}]}
